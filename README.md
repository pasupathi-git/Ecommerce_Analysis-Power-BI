**Ecommerce_Analysis-Power-BI**

**🔍 Project Overview**

This project is a deep-dive data analysis of over 50,000 transactions from the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist. The objective was to move beyond basic reporting to identify specific revenue drivers and logistical inefficiencies that impact the bottom line.

**📈 Key Analytical Insights**

Revenue Concentration : Identified that the top 10 product categories drive 60% of the total revenue.

Scale of Operations : Analyzed a total revenue volume of $13.59M.

Profitability Flagging : Developed a Freight Ratio metric to systematically flag unprofitable SKUs where shipping costs outweighed the product value.

Data Refinement : Performed extensive data cleaning, including renaming columns and titles for professional clarity and enabling a light-mode interface for better readability.
